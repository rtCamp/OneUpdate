Centralized plugin management for WordPress sites via CI/CD. Automate updates across development, staging, and production environments.

== Description ==

OneUpdate is a powerful plugin management solution designed for enterprises managing multiple WordPress sites through CI/CD workflows like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. It streamlines plugin updates, installations, and management across multiple environments by automatically creating pull requests for all changes.

**Why OneUpdate?**

Managing plugin updates across multiple websites in enterprise environments is time-consuming and repetitive. When updates need to flow through multiple environments (develop → staging → production), developers must create separate pull requests for each environment—a tedious workflow.

OneUpdate solves this by providing a centralized governing to manage all sites while automatically creating pull requests for all environments, maintaining proper Git history without commit conflicts.

**Key Benefits:**

* **50% Time Savings:** Reduce plugin update process time significantly
* **Cost Reduction:** Lower operational costs through workflow optimization  
* **Streamlined Workflow:** Centralized management while maintaining site autonomy
* **Security:** REST API with unique authentication keys and secure S3 integration

**Core Features:**

* **Dual Architecture Support:** Works with WordPress multisite and standalone installations
* **Secure API Integration:** REST API with unique authentication keys for safe operations
* **Plugin Browser:** Full-screen admin interface with search and filtering functionality
* **Status Monitoring:** Visual indicators for plugin states (active, update available, deactivated)
* **Version Control:** Install specific versions from the latest 5 available releases
* **Private Plugin Support:** Upload and manage proprietary plugins with S3 integration
* **Bulk Operations:** Update all plugins across multiple sites simultaneously
* **Automated PR Creation:** Generate pull requests for all changes across environments

**Plugin Management Actions:**

* Activate/Deactivate plugins on selected sites
* Update plugins to specific versions (latest 5 versions available)
* Install new plugins from WordPress.org repository
* Upload and manage private plugins (expires after 1 hour for security)
* Bulk update all available plugins
* Remove plugins from specific sites
* Real-time plugin status tracking

**Perfect for:**

* Enterprise WordPress deployments
* Development teams using CI/CD workflows
* Agencies managing multiple client sites
* Organizations with strict deployment processes
* Sites hosted on platforms like WordPress VIP
