## Overview

OneUpdate is a centralized plugin management solution designed for enterprises managing multiple WordPress sites through CI/CD workflows (like GitHub Actions). It streamlines plugin updates, installation, and management across multiple environments (development → staging → production) by automatically creating pull requests for all changes.

## Description

**OneUpdate** is a centralized plugin manager for WordPress. From a single governing site, you can:

* **Install, update, and downgrade** plugins (with access to the latest 5 versions).  
* **Activate, deactivate, and uninstall** plugins across multiple sites.  
* Manage **public plugins** from WordPress.org and **private plugins** uploaded securely to your S3 instance.

This makes it easier to keep plugins consistent, secure, and up to date across all your WordPress environments.

## Why OneUpdate?

Managing plugin updates in a network of standalone sites in enterprise environments, where updates need to flow through multiple environments (develop → preprod → production), is a highly inefficient process. This can also lead to tech drift — brand sites diverging to such a level that managing them requires separate teams and effort.

OneUpdate solves this by:

- **Centralizing Management:** Single governing to manage plugins on all brand sites  
- **Automating PR Creation:** Automatically creates pull requests for all environments  
- **Maintaining Git History:** Uses single branch from base branch to prevent commit conflicts  
- **Enterprise-Ready:** Built specifically for CI/CD-based WordPress deployments

### Key Benefits

- **Reduced effort:** Significantly reduce plugin management effort and time  
- **Streamlined workflows:** Centralized management while maintaining site autonomy  
- **Stack consolidation:** Helps brands converge on to a common stack of plugins, increasing compatibility and reusability  
- **Cost reduction:** Ultimately, reduced efforts and reduced time \= cost reduction
